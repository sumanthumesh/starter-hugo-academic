I am a 2nd Year Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, advised by Dr. [Reetuparna Das](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~reetudas/). I am interested in optimizing the memory architecture for memory bandwidth-bound or latency-bound workloads. My current work uses Compute Express Link (CXL) for memory expansion and host-accelerator/accelerator-accelerator interfaces.

Before starting my Ph.D., I was a hardware engineer at NVIDIA and Silicon Labs, where I worked on the microarchitecture of PCIe controllers and cryptographic accelerators, respectively.
