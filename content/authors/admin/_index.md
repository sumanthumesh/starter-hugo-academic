I am a 2nd Year PhD student at the Mbit Lab in the University of Michigan advised by [Dr. Reetuparna Das](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~reetudas/). My primary research focus is on optimizing the memory architecture for improving the performance of memory bandwidth-bound or latency-bound workloads. My current work involves using Compute Express Link (CXL) for memory expansion and host-accelerator/accelerator-accelerator interfaces.

Before starting my PhD I was a hardware engineer at NVIDIA and Silicon Labs where I worked on PCIe controller and cryptographic accelerators respectively. I received my Btech in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur in 2020.
