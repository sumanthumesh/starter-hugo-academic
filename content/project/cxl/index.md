title: CXL Based Memory Expansion for Databases
# summary: Designed a N-Way superscalar RISC-V core `external_link`.
summary: CXL memory expansion enabled system for large in-memory databases to  avoid I/O accesses. Tables are paritioned and placed in the DRAM -> CXL-memory hierarchical structure based on query workload analysis and mapped to CXL devices to exploit device level parallelism to reduce average access latency
