title: CXL Enabled Large Language Model Accelerator 
# summary: Designed a N-Way superscalar RISC-V core `external_link`.
summary: Processing in Memory based LLM accelerator with processing units placed adjacent to memory banks. Multiple PIM accelerators are connected using a CXL network to accomodate the large paramter sizes. Each CXL attached accelerator also has a set of specialized functional units and a RISC-V core to support operations that cannot be executed solely on the PIM PUs.
